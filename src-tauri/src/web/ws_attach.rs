//! WS attach protocol — Phase 1 of the Subscribe-with-Snapshot redesign.
//!
//! Replaces the legacy "subscribe to a global firehose + fetch HTTP snapshot
//! separately" flow. A client expressing interest in a specific connection
//! sends an `attach` message; the server atomically (under the SessionState
//! read lock) decides between a `snapshot` or `replay` response and
//! registers a per-connection broadcast receiver. After the response, live
//! events from that connection are delivered as `event` frames over the
//! same WebSocket.
//!
//! The legacy global `acp://event` channel remains active during Phase 1-3
//! for backward compatibility; Phase 4 retires it.
