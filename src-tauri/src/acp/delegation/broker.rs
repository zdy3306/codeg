//! `DelegationBroker` — the coordination unit for multi-agent delegation.
//!
//! Delegation is **asynchronous**: `delegate_to_agent` returns a `task_id`
//! ack as soon as setup finishes; the LLM collects the result later with
//! `get_delegation_status` (optionally long-polling) or stops it with
//! `cancel_delegation`. There is no blocking `oneshot` — a running task is just
//! an entry in the `running` map, and a terminal event migrates it into the
//! `completed` cache (atomically, under one lock) and wakes any long-poll via
//! `result_notify`.
//!
//! Lifecycle of a single task:
//!
//! 1. [`DelegationBroker::start_delegation`] is the broker's entry point. The
//!    MCP listener feeds it the LLM-issued `delegate_to_agent` payload.
//! 2. Pre-checks: feature enabled? depth limit ok? Both failures return a
//!    terminal report immediately, no child session created.
//! 3. Spawn the child via [`ConnectionSpawner::spawn`].
//! 4. Send the delegation task as the first prompt via
//!    [`ConnectionSpawner::send_prompt_linked_for_delegation`]. The trailing
//!    [`DelegationLink`] carries the parent's `tool_use_id` and a
//!    broker-internal `call_id` (UUID = `task_id`) — persisted onto the new
//!    conversation row so the lifecycle resolver can find it.
//! 5. Register a [`RunningTask`] keyed by `call_id` and return a `Running` ack
//!    [`DelegationTaskReport`] (or a terminal report when the child finished
//!    during setup / a cancel reached it mid-setup / setup itself failed).
//! 6. Later, a terminal event resolves the task — migrating it `running` →
//!    `completed` and tearing the child down:
//!       - the lifecycle calling [`DelegationBroker::complete_call`] on
//!         `TurnComplete` (happy path), or
//!       - a cancel — MCP-side (`notifications/cancelled` →
//!         [`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_external_handle`]), child-side
//!         ([`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_child_connection`]), parent-side
//!         ([`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_parent`] /
//!         [`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_parent_turn`]), or the LLM's own
//!         [`DelegationBroker::cancel_task_by_id`].
//!
//! v1 is explicitly one-shot — no session reuse.
//!
//! Result durability: child output is NOT stored in codeg's DB, so the broker
//! caches the completed text in `completed` (parent-scoped, FIFO-capped). Once
//! evicted, [`DelegationBroker::get_task_status`] falls back to the DB for the
//! task's terminal STATUS (via [`ChildStatusLookup`]); the full output is always
//! viewable in the child's own session.
//!
//! Cancellation cascade: when a parent session goes away (user-initiated
//! cancel, parent disconnect), the lifecycle subscriber calls
//! [`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_parent`] which fans out cancel + disconnect
//! to every running child of that parent. A normal `end_turn` does NOT cancel
//! children — they keep running in the background (the whole point of async).
