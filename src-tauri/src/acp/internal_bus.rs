//! In-process ACP event bus.
//!
//! Carries `Arc<EventEnvelope>` directly to back-end consumers (lifecycle,
//! pet state mapper, chat-channel subscribers). Distinct from
//! `WebEventBroadcaster`, which carries `Arc<serde_json::Value>` for
//! transport-bound JSON delivery to WS clients.
//!
//! Two reasons to split the buses:
//!
//! 1. **No JSON parse on the consumer side.** Every back-end subscriber used
//!    to call `serde_json::from_value(payload.clone())` on the broadcaster's
//!    `WebEvent.payload`, paying the parse cost per event per subscriber.
//!    With a typed bus they receive the envelope directly.
//!
//! 2. **No frontend dedup needed.** Before the split, web/remote-desktop WS
//!    clients received `acp://event` from BOTH the per-connection attach
//!    stream AND the global broadcaster firehose, forcing a receiver-side
//!    dedup `Set<connectionId>` on the client. With ACP events removed from
//!    the global broadcaster, the per-connection stream is the sole path
//!    and the dedup goes away.
