//! Background subscriber that watches the in-process `InternalEventBus` for
//! ACP events that need cross-connection DB persistence (e.g. binding the
//! agent's external session id onto a conversation row when SessionStarted
//! fires). Decoupled from `emit_with_state` so the emit hot path stays
//! lock-tight.
//!
//! Phase 5: migrated from `WebEventBroadcaster` (JSON-shape) to
//! `InternalEventBus` (typed `Arc<EventEnvelope>`). Eliminates the
//! per-event `serde_json::from_value` reparse and lets us drop the
