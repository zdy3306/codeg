//! `codeg-server --supervise` — a minimal process supervisor that owns the
//! lifecycle of the real worker so an in-place upgrade can swap the binary
//! and have the *new* version relaunched deterministically.
//!
//! In Docker this process is PID 1, so it also has to behave like an init:
//! forward `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` to the worker for graceful container stop, and
//! reap reparented orphan children so they don't pile up as zombies.
//!
//! Relaunch contract: the worker performs the file swap and then exits with
//! [`crate::update::runtime::EXIT_RESTART`]. We wait `CODEG_RESTART_DELAY_MS`
//! and respawn from the (now replaced) executable path.
//!
//! Failed-upgrade self-heal: a worker we just relaunched *because of* an
//! upgrade is on probation. If it exits abnormally within
//! `CODEG_UPGRADE_TRIAL_SECS` (the new binary can't even boot), we restore
//! the previous bundle from its `.bak` artifacts and relaunch that — once.
//! This is the one recovery path that does **not** depend on the (now dead)
//! HTTP rollback endpoint. Any other exit is propagated as-is — a fatal
//! config error or a crash after the trial window should stop the process
//! (and, under a container restart policy, fall back to the image) rather
//! than hot-loop.
