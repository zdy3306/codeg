/**
 * Surfaces folders opened from the project launcher (a separate window/tab).
 * The launcher scaffolds a project; the backend upserts the folder and emits
 * `folder://open-in-workspace`. Here we add it to this workspace and open a
 * draft conversation tab so it lands focused.
 *
 * Routing is handled by the transport: `subscribe()` binds to this window's
 * own backend (the local Tauri bus, or the server's WebSocket for web/remote),
 * so only windows talking to the backend that opened the folder react — no
 * manual connection filtering needed. The detail rides on the event, so no
 * extra round-trip is required to apply it.
