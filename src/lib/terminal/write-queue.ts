/**
 * Ordered, single-flight write pump for terminal input.
 *
 * Terminal input must reach the PTY in exactly the order it was typed. The
 * transport `call()` channel underneath `terminalWrite` gives NO cross-call
 * ordering guarantee: Tauri v2 dispatches concurrent `invoke`s on a thread
 * pool (whichever finishes first resolves first), and the web/remote paths are
 * independent HTTP POSTs (unordered, connection-pool-limited). Firing one
 * fire-and-forget call per keystroke therefore scrambles fast input.
 *
 * This queue restores ordering the way VS Code / xterm.js do it — a single
 * ordered channel — by serializing: at most ONE `send` is in flight, and the
 * next batch waits for the previous to resolve. Because the backend enqueues
 * bytes into its FIFO PTY-writer channel *before* the call returns, awaiting
 * each send guarantees end-to-end type order regardless of transport
 * reordering.
 *
 * Bytes typed while a send is in flight coalesce into the next batch — fewer,
 * larger sends, the same "event batching" the VS Code pty-host uses — so fast
 * typing and paste collapse to a handful of round-trips instead of one per
 * character.
 *
 * Failure policy: a failed send is DROPPED, never retried. The only "ack" the
 * transport gives us is the call resolving — there is no signal distinguishing
 * "the bytes reached the PTY" from "they didn't" when a request times out or
 * the connection drops mid-flight. Re-sending an ambiguous batch risks
 * DUPLICATING already-delivered input, and a duplicated control byte (Enter,
 * Ctrl-C, a pasted command) is worse in a shell than a dropped one. So we
 * favor at-most-once over at-least-once. (This matches the prior
 * fire-and-forget behavior on failure — we only add ordering, never a new
 * duplication risk. Eliminating loss too would require a backend write-ack /
 * idempotency layer, which is out of scope here.)
